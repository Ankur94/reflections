hello , how are you?
what is your name ?
my name is Ankur
why are you using sublime text editor, why not notepad++ ?

Using version control can make you a better programmer , how ?

Ans: We can visit the older version and compare them to reflect the changes made in the file. 

SAVING MANUALLY VS AUTO

Manual saving (eg. git) - 
Pros :
Its gives you the authority , when to save the file .
Unnecessary commits efforts are save and cluttering is avoided.

Cons:
One may miss to commit some vital functionality changes made.

Auto Saving (eg. dropbox) -
Pros :
You will never miss the changes made to the file.

Cons:
Unnecessary cluttering of files in history , even if no significant changes are made.

MULTI - FILE COMMITS

Git : Its good because it gives you a complete view of the changes made and what are the affects on the whole system rather than on a single file.
 
Google Docs : it may get harder to correlate the changes affecting the different files. 


NOW as i learned how to use git diff and git log
commands : git log
         : git diff current_id previous_id  #remember the revert control  example


using version control helps me out to restore the code to a given commit of my choice, this makes is very useful and interesting.
